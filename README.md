# 🧬 Skin Disease Detector using Deep Learning & Streamlit

A deep learning-powered web application that detects **8 common skin diseases** from an uploaded image using a pre-trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. Built with **TensorFlow/Keras** and **Streamlit**, the app provides real-time predictions along with diagnosis information like description, medications, and precautions.
